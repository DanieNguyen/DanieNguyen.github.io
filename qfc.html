                <p>For my visual communication and design final project, I was required to rebrand a company based in Washington, providing a mock-up of: 
                <ul>
                    <li>a logo</li>
                    <li>a website</li>
                    <li>a set of posters</li>
                    <li>a paper document</li>
                </ul>
                I chose to redesign QFC because I wanted to tackle on the challenge of rebranding for a large company. My vision for the QFC rebrand was to make QFC a <b>friendlier</b> and <b>modern</b> grocery store. Please view my work and design process below.</p>

                <p class='header2'><b>Research</b></p>
                <p>My QFC rebrand started with research. I researched the current QFC brand as well as competing grocery stores such as Target, Walmart, and Albertson's. I also looked for different inspirations and concepts. During this research phase of two days, I brainstormed different concepts for my redesigns. Ultimately, I decided on rebranding to 'The Q' when I found a
                <a href='https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/qfc-may-re-brand-to-the-q/281-536261750'>King5 article</a> where the president of QFC stated that QFC may rebrand to 'The Q'.</p>
                <p class='header2'><b>Identity</b></p>
                <p>For this project, I started by first coming up with a brand identity. My thinking was not for a subtle QFC rebrand but a radical change into a friendly and modern grocery store. Looking at the competiting grocery stores such as Walmart and Target who have evolved to become bigger and futuristic brands made me want to do the same for QFC. My focus was friendly and modern so I committed to moving forward with minimalist, colorful designs. I wanted a brand that was versatile like the recent rebranding of the Juventus soccer team.</p>
                <p class='header2'><b>Logo</b></p>
                <p>My first piece was the logo because the logo is the most essential piece of a new brand identity. Looking back at the old QFC logo, the blue and yellow contrasting colors were not friendly and having the words "Quality Food Center" under the "QFC" made it seem tacky. For my redesigned logo, I paid tribute to QFC by combining the blue and yellow hues of the old logo into a friendly green and using 'the' as a crown like the old logo. I also paid tribute to Washington by creating the image of a sun over a mountain for Mt. Rainier with the 'Q'.</p>

                <p class='header2'><b>Website</b></p>
                <p></p>Redoing the QFC website was difficult because there was not a lot to use from the current QFC's website. The current QFC website is very uniform and bland. Since QFC is owned by Kroger, the QFC website was identical to Fred Meyer's and all other Kroger project stores' websites. Since my project was near the end of spring, the QFC website was advertising summer sales and deals. I chose vibrant colors and images to create a summer feel. The website layout was designed to be easily navigated. My font for the websites were chosen for their readability and welcoming nature.</p>

                <p class='header2'><b>Poster</b></p>
                <p>The constraints for the posters were that they had to be 24x36 inches and had to include 3 different products the company had. I decided to create a set of posters that would be posted on the walls of the Q, each with a different 'product'. Since it was hard for me to narrow down three signature QFC products, I addressed unique QFC elements with a rewards card poster, employment poster, and signature brand poster. </p>

                <p>The document needed to be an 8.5x11 inch document showing various levels of hierarchy. For this, I created a recipe flyer for customers to grab inside the stores.</p>
