            <div class='content1'>
                <p>For Project ARTogether, I was hired as a graphic design and social media intern. Throughout the internship, I was in charge of 
                <ul>
                    <li>creating promotional and instructional videos</li>
                    <li>running the Youtube Channel</li>
                    <li>running the Twitter page</li>
                    <li>running the Instagram</li>
                </ul>
                I chose to work here over the summer because of the inspiring work of the company. Project ARTogether strives to unite refugees in the San Francisco community by holding art classes and group activities. </p>

                <p class='header2'><b>Initial Learning</b></p>
                <p>Project ARTogether is based in San Francisco, California so my internship was remote. I had to learn a new communication software, Asana in order to communicate with my manager. For the first two weeks of my internship, I was given access to the ARTogether brand and was told to learn and brainstorm about different social media ideas.</p>
                <p class='header2'><b>Youtube Channel</b></p>
                <p>My first assigned project was to revamp Project ARTogether's YouTube channel. Their previous channel was essentially a video drive, where they uploaded all their videos with no information at all. In addition, their Youtube Channel was private and had nothing on their channel page. I started by creating a cover photo for their channel and organizing/deleting their videos. After that, I worked with a fellow intern, a video editor, in order to create new content for their Youtube Channel. We created three new videos and are still creating more to introduce people to what ARTogether does. So far, we have a channel introduction video as well as two videos introducing the two main art workshops/meetings that Project ARTogether puts together.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Motion Graphics</b></p>
                <p>For the Youtube Videos, I was assigned to create different animations to use for all future videos. This was a difficult process,because my manager had many different ideas for me to try out. I worked in Adobe Illustrator and After Effects for a week to come up with designs. We settled on a starting animation for the brand and an ending animation for promoting the website. The starting animation shows the logo bouncing in as a playful introduction to videos while the ending animation shows a globe transitioning into the logo to represent how Project ARTOgether is a public organization for everyone. </p>
                <p class='header2'><b>Twitter</b></p>
                <p>After working on the Youtube Channel for around two months, I was relegated to monitoring the Project ARTogether Twitter page. My work for the Twitter page was to creat engaging posts that related to politics and refugees a couple times a week. The secondary goal was to increase the number of followers. Currently, I am running the Twitter with a team of three other members and we each try to have relevant articles or retweets about refugees. So far, we have slowly been gaining followers.</p>
