                <p>For my user-centered design course, I worked in a team of 4 in order to create a user-centered product for urban beekeepers. Our product focuses on helping beekeepers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitor their bees remotely</li>
                    <li>Maintain beehive health factors</li>
                    <li>Record important beehive statistics</li>
                    <li>Continue beekeeping with inexpensive costs</li>
                </ul>
                Our team went through the full user-centered design process to create Hive Queen. Please view a shortened version of our work and design process below. For the full write-up, please click this <a href='https://daniespam26.wixsite.com/huxney' target="_blank">link here</a>.</p>

                <p class='header2'><b>User Research</b></p>
                <p>For this project, our team chose a user group that none of us were familiar with in order to eliminate existing bias. We chose beekeepers randomly and conducted in-depth interviews with four different beekeepers. Using this information, we created user personas, story boards, and user journey maps to identify and evaluate the different pain points that beekeepers currently have. After four weeks of research, our team started to think of solutions through brainstorming and focusing on our decided design requirements.</p>
                <p class='header2'><b>Prototyping</b></p>
                <p>For the next two weeks, we focused on prototyping and wireframing. Our chosen solution was a physical hive monitoring system connected to a mobile application for beekeepers to use. This combination would allow beekeepers to easily overcome their pain points of not being able to check on their beehives due to location or weather. Our team used paper prototypes and Figma to draw our mobile application and hive system.</p>
                <p class='header2'><b>Usability Testing</b></p>
                <p>Then after creating our prototypes, we had to conduct user testing in order to make sure our product was actually good for the users. We found out through first impressions and task walk-throughs that our mobile application could be madae more efficient and simpler. Our team realized we were trying to add too many features that took away from the purpose of the hive system. Thanks to the user testing, we revised our designs and then created high fidelity mock-ups.</p>
                <p class='header2'><b>High Fidelity Mock-Ups</b></p>
                <p>Our high fidelity mock-ups for the mobile application were made in Figma, with 22 different screens, and the physical hive monitoring system was designed in Solidworks and 3D printed. These mock-ups took a week to design. The last part of the project was presenting it to various companies in order to see if it was something that they would sponsor. We created a presentation using the high fidelity mock-ups and ended with a 100% rate of support for our project.</p>
